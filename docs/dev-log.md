## üéØ Milestone 1: Scaffolding & Foundation

**Date**: December 2024  
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED  
**Goal**: Initialize monorepo structure and basic setup

### ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] Created monorepo directory structure
- [x] Created comprehensive README.md
- [x] Created dev-log.md
- [x] Created blueprint.md (already existed)
- [x] Initialize Next.js frontend with TypeScript + Tailwind + ShadCN
- [x] Initialize Node.js backend with Express + MongoDB connection
- [x] Initialize FastAPI AI service with hello-world endpoint
- [x] Set up CI/CD workflows with GitHub Actions
- [x] Create package.json files for each app
- [x] Set up Docker configuration for all services
- [x] Configure TypeScript for backend
- [x] Create basic API routes structure
- [x] Set up error handling middleware
- [x] Create AI service with mock endpoints
- [x] Set up development environment and scripts

### üîÑ In Progress
- None - Milestone 1 completed!

### üìù Decisions Made
- **Monorepo Structure**: Using apps/ directory for better organization
- **Tech Stack**: Confirmed Next.js 14, Node.js, FastAPI, MongoDB
- **UI Framework**: ShadCN UI with Tailwind CSS for modern, accessible components
- **Authentication**: Will evaluate between Clerk and NextAuth.js during implementation
- **Docker Strategy**: Containerized development environment for consistency
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with separate jobs for each service
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with proper error handling and validation

### üêõ Issues & Challenges
- None encountered during scaffolding

### üí° Next Steps
1. Test the development environment
2. Begin Milestone 2: Core Logistics Flow
3. Implement order and shipment models
4. Connect frontend to backend APIs

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Decisions

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first approach
- **Components**: ShadCN UI for consistent, accessible components
- **State Management**: React Context + hooks (consider Zustand for complex state)

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas for flexibility with logistics data
- **API Design**: RESTful with proper error handling and validation
- **Validation**: Custom error handling with status codes

### AI Service Architecture
- **Framework**: FastAPI for high performance and auto-documentation
- **ML Libraries**: Scikit-learn for classical ML, PyTorch Lightning for deep learning
- **Model Deployment**: Containerized with Docker
- **API Communication**: HTTP REST between services

### Infrastructure
- **Development**: Docker Compose for local development
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with automated testing and deployment
- **Containerization**: All services containerized for consistency

### Database Schema (Planned)
```typescript
// Core entities
interface Shipment {
  id: string;
  shipper: Shipper;
  consignee: Consignee;
  cargo: CargoDetails;
  route: Route;
  status: ShipmentStatus;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

interface Route {
  id: string;
  origin: Location;
  destination: Location;
  waypoints: Location[];
  estimatedDuration: number;
  co2Footprint: number;
  compliance: ComplianceStatus;
}
```
