## 🚀 How to Get Started

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
# Install root dependencies
npm install

# Install frontend dependencies
cd apps/frontend && npm install

# Install backend dependencies
cd ../backend && npm install

# Install AI service dependencies
cd ../ai-service && pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Start Development Environment
```bash
# Option 1: Start all services
npm run dev

# Option 2: Start services individually
npm run dev:frontend    # Frontend on http://localhost:3000
npm run dev:backend     # Backend on http://localhost:3001
npm run dev:ai          # AI Service on http://localhost:8001
```

### 3. Docker Development (Alternative)
```bash
# Start all services with Docker
docker-compose up

# Or start specific service
docker-compose up frontend backend ai-service
```
