Here’s an updated **`blueprint.md`** for **Lodix** that reflects the end-to-end flow, milestones, and clarity you’ll want for an MVP build with Cursor:

---

# Lodix – Blueprint

**Description**:
Lodix is an AI-powered logistics platform designed to optimize end-to-end supply chains in the EU. It tackles inefficiencies across demand forecasting, route optimization, warehouse operations, compliance, and last-mile delivery. The MVP focuses on building a modular foundation with AI-assisted insights at each step.

---

## Core Vision

* Provide a **single intelligent layer** for EU logistics companies.
* Reduce waste in **planning, routing, warehousing, and delivery**.
* Solve **real bottlenecks** with **AI-driven recommendations** instead of replacing existing systems.
* Start with an MVP, expand to advanced integrations (ERP, IoT, customs) in later phases.

---

## End-to-End Process (MVP Scope)

1. **Demand Forecasting & Planning**

   * AI models to predict shipment volumes based on historical + seasonal data.
   * Helps reduce under/over capacity planning.

2. **Shipment Booking & Order Management**

   * Interface to log/import shipment requests.
   * Automated consolidation recommendations (group shipments).

3. **Warehouse & Inventory Visibility**

   * Track incoming/outgoing shipments.
   * Basic anomaly detection for stock mismatches.

4. **Route Optimization & Fleet Management**

   * AI-driven optimal routes (traffic, fuel, restrictions, emissions).
   * Prioritize sustainability (EU emissions norms).

5. **Compliance & Documentation (EU Focus)**

   * Auto-check for missing docs before customs/export.
   * Smart alerts for regulatory discrepancies.

6. **Last-Mile Delivery & Tracking**

   * Real-time tracking dashboard for deliveries.
   * Predictive ETA updates.

7. **Analytics & Insights**

   * Operational dashboard.
   * Metrics: delivery times, route efficiency, emissions saved.

---

## Tech Stack (MVP)

* **Frontend**: Next.js + ShadCN UI + Tailwind
* **Backend**: Node.js (Express)
* **Database**: MongoDB (Atlas)
* **AI/ML**: Python microservice (FastAPI)

  * Demand forecasting → Prophet/Scikit-learn
  * Route optimization → OR-Tools + custom heuristics
* **Auth**: Supabase Auth (simple for MVP)
* **Deployment**: Vercel (frontend) + Railway/Render (backend + ML)

---

## Milestones

### Milestone 1 – Setup & Foundation

* Initialize repo with monorepo structure (apps: frontend, backend, ai-service).
* Add `blueprint.md` & `dev-log.md`.
* Setup CI/CD with GitHub Actions.
* Basic landing page with project description.

**Commit & Push**:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Init repo with Lodix foundation: monorepo, blueprint, dev-log"
git push origin main
```

---

### Milestone 2 – Core Backend & AI Service

* Node.js backend with shipment API endpoints.
* MongoDB connection.
* FastAPI AI service: basic demand forecast model + route optimizer stub.

**Commit & Push**:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add backend APIs and AI service stubs (forecasting, routing)"
git push origin main
```

---

### Milestone 3 – Frontend UI (Booking + Dashboard)

* Next.js dashboard with login (Supabase).
* Shipment booking form.
* Dashboard with shipment list + forecast data widget.

**Commit & Push**:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add frontend booking form and dashboard with AI forecast widget"
git push origin main
```

---

### Milestone 4 – Route Optimization & Tracking

* AI service returns optimized route.
* Frontend map integration (Leaflet/Mapbox).
* ETA prediction display.

**Commit & Push**:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Integrate AI route optimization and live tracking map"
git push origin main
```

---

### Milestone 5 – Compliance & Insights

* Compliance check rules for missing docs.
* Analytics dashboard (basic charts).

**Commit & Push**:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add compliance module and analytics dashboard"
git push origin main
```

---

### Milestone 6 – Polish & Deploy

* UI/UX refinements.
* Final testing + deploy to Vercel/Render.
* Document process in `dev-log.md`.

**Commit & Push**:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Polish UI, finalize deployment, update dev-log"
git push origin main
```

---

## Deliverables (MVP)

* **Blueprint** (`blueprint.md`) – this file.
* **Dev Log** (`dev-log.md`) – ongoing build notes.
* **Working MVP** with booking, AI forecasts, route optimization, and compliance checks.
* **Deployed app** (Frontend on Vercel, backend/AI on Railway/Render).
